# STUNner demo: Direct one to one video call via STUNner

This is a demo adopted from the Kurento [Node.js - One to one video
call](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/node/tutorial-one2one.html) demo. To
quote the original Kurento documentation:

> This web application consists of a one-to-one video call using WebRTC technology. In other words,
> this application provides a simple video softphone.

This demo is essentially the same as the STUNner [One to one video
call](examples/kurento-one2one-call) demo, with the exception that this demo does not feature a
media server, that is, users connect directly via STUNner, without the mediation of a media server.

For more information, consult the documentation for the STUNner [One to one video
call](examples/kurento-one2one-call/README.md) documentation.
